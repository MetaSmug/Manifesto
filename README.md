## Talking points

Obsessive focus on materializing your specific vision into reality

Obsessive focus on streamlining workflow to maximize capturing creative spurts

Relentless pursuit of excellence and self-improvement

Bragging rights

Increasing compatibility

Reducing barriers to entry

## Roadmap
